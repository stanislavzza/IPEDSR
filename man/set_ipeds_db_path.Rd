\title{Configure where the IPEDS database will be stored}
\usage{
set_ipeds_db_path(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character scalar. The directory in which the IPEDS database file
should live. Tilde (\code{~}) is allowed and will be expanded.}
}
\value{
(Invisibly) the normalized, expanded directory path that was set.
}
\description{
Persists a user-selected directory in a YAML config file so
  future calls use this directory instead of the default. Verifies that the
  directory exists (or creates it) and is writable.
}
\details{
Set the IPEDS database directory (persisted in YAML)

The configuration is written to
  \code{file.path(rappdirs::user_config_dir("IPEDSR"), "config.yml")} with
  a single key \code{db_path}. If you later remove or edit this file, the
  package will fall back to its default location.

  This function will attempt to create the directory (recursively) if it does
  not exist and will test write permissions by creating and deleting a probe
  file inside the directory.
