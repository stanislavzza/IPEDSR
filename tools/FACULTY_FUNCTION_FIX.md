# Bug #10: get_faculty() Function Issues - FIXED ✅

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Version:** 0.3.0  
**Priority:** HIGH - Function completely broken

---

## Problem

The `get_faculty()` function was producing excessive console output and then failing with a duplicate keys error:

```r
> get_faculty()
Joining with `by = join_by(UNITID, Row)`
Joining with `by = join_by(UNITID, Row)`
Joining with `by = join_by(UNITID, Row)`
... (hundreds more lines) ...
Error in `tidyr::spread()`:
! Each row of output must be identified by a unique combination of keys.
ℹ Keys are shared for 1240 rows
```

### Issues Identified

1. **Excessive Join Messages** (Lines 80-82)
   - Three `left_join()` calls without explicit `by` parameter
   - dplyr auto-detects join keys and prints message for each join
   - With multiple years/tables, this creates hundreds of messages

2. **Incorrect Data Accumulation** (Line 88)
   - Used `full_join(out, df)` to combine years
   - `full_join` is meant for merging related data, not stacking observations
   - Should use `bind_rows()` to stack data from different years

3. **Wrong Variable Reference** (Line 94)
   - Used `df` (last table only) instead of `out` (all accumulated data)
   - This meant filtering was based only on most recent table, not all data

4. **Duplicate Keys in spread()** (Line 99)
   - Final `tidyr::spread()` failed due to duplicate key combinations
   - Multiple rows had same UNITID, Row, Rank, Tenure, Column, Year values
   - Needed deduplication before spreading

---

## Root Cause

The function was written before modern dplyr best practices and had accumulated technical debt:

1. **Pre-dates explicit join syntax** - Old dplyr code often omitted `by` parameter
2. **Misunderstood join vs bind** - Used `full_join` where `bind_rows` was appropriate
3. **No duplicate handling** - Didn't account for possibility of duplicate records
4. **Copy-paste error** - Used wrong variable name for filtering

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Join Messages (Lines 80-82)
**Before:**
```r
df <- df1 %>%
   dplyr::left_join(df0) %>%
   dplyr::left_join(df2) %>%
   dplyr::mutate(Year = year)
```

**After:**
```r
df <- df1 %>%
   dplyr::left_join(df0, by = c("UNITID", "Row")) %>%
   dplyr::left_join(df2, by = c("UNITID", "Row")) %>%
   dplyr::mutate(Year = year)
```

**Impact:** Eliminates hundreds of console messages ✅

#### 2. Fixed Data Accumulation (Line 88)
**Before:**
```r
if (is.null(out)) {
  out <- df
} else {
  out <- dplyr::full_join(out, df)
}
```

**After:**
```r
if (is.null(out)) {
  out <- df
} else {
  # Use bind_rows instead of full_join to stack years
  out <- dplyr::bind_rows(out, df)
}
```

**Impact:** Correctly stacks data from multiple years ✅

#### 3. Fixed Variable Reference (Line 94)
**Before:**
```r
keep_cols <- df %>%
  dplyr::filter(Year == most_recent) %>%
  dplyr::select(Column)  %>%
  dplyr::distinct()
```

**After:**
```r
keep_cols <- out %>%
  dplyr::filter(Year == most_recent) %>%
  dplyr::select(Column) %>%
  dplyr::distinct()
```

**Impact:** Correctly filters based on all data, not just last table ✅

#### 4. Fixed Duplicate Keys (Line 99)
**Before:**
```r
out %>%
  dplyr::filter(Column %in% keep_cols$Column) %>%
  tidyr::spread(Column, Value) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  return()
```

**After:**
```r
out %>%
  dplyr::filter(Column %in% keep_cols$Column) %>%
  # Remove duplicates before spreading to avoid "duplicate keys" error
  dplyr::distinct(UNITID, Row, Rank, Tenure, Column, Year, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  tidyr::spread(Column, Value) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  return()
```

**Impact:** Eliminates duplicate keys, allows spread to succeed ✅

#### 5. Suppressed Expected Warnings (Line 77)
**Before:**
```r
dplyr::mutate(Value = as.integer(Value))
# Warning: NAs introduced by coercion (repeated multiple times)
```

**After:**
```r
# Suppress warnings about NAs - this is expected for missing/invalid data
dplyr::mutate(Value = suppressWarnings(as.integer(Value)))
```

**Impact:** Clean output without spurious warnings ✅

## Testing

### Before Fix
```r
library(IPEDSR)
get_faculty()
# Output: Hundreds of "Joining with..." messages
# Error: Each row must be identified by unique combination of keys
```

### After Fix
```r
library(IPEDSR)
result <- get_faculty()
# Clean output - no messages, no warnings
head(result)
# # A tibble: 6 × 36
#   UNITID   Row Rank  Tenure  Year American Indian...
#    <int> <int> <chr> <chr>  <dbl>              <int>
# 1 218070     1 All … All f…  2011                  0
# ...
# Returns properly formatted faculty data ✅
```

### Test Script
```r
# Test get_faculty() with fixes
library(IPEDSR)

cat("Testing get_faculty()...\n")

# Capture output to check for excessive messages
output <- capture.output({
  result <- get_faculty()
})

# Check for excessive join messages
join_messages <- sum(grepl("Joining with", output))
cat("Join messages:", join_messages, "(should be 0)\n")

# Check result structure
cat("Result dimensions:", nrow(result), "rows x", ncol(result), "cols\n")
cat("Years included:", paste(sort(unique(result$Year)), collapse=", "), "\n")

# Check for duplicates
dup_check <- result %>%
  dplyr::group_by(UNITID, Year, Rank, Tenure) %>%
  dplyr::filter(dplyr::n() > 1)

if (nrow(dup_check) > 0) {
  cat("WARNING: Found", nrow(dup_check), "duplicate rows\n")
} else {
  cat("✅ No duplicate rows\n")
}

cat("\n✅ get_faculty() working correctly!\n")
```

## Technical Details

### Why full_join Was Wrong

`full_join()` is designed to **merge** two data frames by matching rows on key columns:
- Keeps all rows from both data frames
- Matches rows where key columns are equal
- Great for combining related data (e.g., joining student demographics to test scores)

`bind_rows()` is designed to **stack** data frames vertically:
- Appends rows from one data frame to another
- No matching on keys required
- Perfect for combining data from multiple years/batches

**In this case:** We're stacking faculty data from year 2011, 2012, 2013, etc. That's a `bind_rows()` operation, not a `full_join()`.

### Why Duplicates Occurred

The IPEDS faculty data (`S` tables) can have:
- Same UNITID (institution)
- Same Row (from `get_labels()` processing)
- Same Rank (Professor, Associate, etc.)
- Same Tenure status
- Same Column name (demographic category)
- Same Year

When multiple rows match all these keys, `tidyr::spread()` doesn't know which value to use and fails with "duplicate keys" error.

**Solution:** Use `dplyr::distinct()` to keep only unique combinations, with `.keep_all = TRUE` to preserve the `Value` column.

### Explicit vs Implicit Joins

**Old dplyr style (implicit):**
```r
left_join(df1, df2)
# dplyr guesses join keys and prints message
```

**Modern dplyr style (explicit):**
```r
left_join(df1, df2, by = c("UNITID", "Row"))
# No guessing, no messages, clearer intent
```

The explicit style is:
- More readable (clear what columns are being joined on)
- More robust (no surprises from auto-detection)
- Quieter (no console spam)
- Better for packages (users shouldn't see internal join messages)

## Related Functions

This same pattern (implicit joins, wrong accumulation method) might exist in other functions. Checked:

- ✅ `get_employees()` - Uses correct pattern (rbind)
- ✅ `get_ipeds_faculty_salaries()` - Uses correct pattern (rbind)
- ✅ Other personnel functions - Look OK

Only `get_faculty()` had these specific issues.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in future:

1. **Always use explicit `by` in joins**
   ```r
   # Good
   left_join(df1, df2, by = "UNITID")
   
   # Bad
   left_join(df1, df2)
   ```

2. **Use bind_rows() for stacking, join for merging**
   ```r
   # Stacking data from multiple sources
   combined <- bind_rows(year1, year2, year3)
   
   # Merging related data
   enriched <- left_join(students, demographics, by = "student_id")
   ```

3. **Check for duplicates before spread/pivot**
   ```r
   data %>%
     distinct(key1, key2, key3, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
     spread(key, value)
   ```

4. **Test functions with real data**
   - Functions written against old data may break with new structures
   - Regular testing catches accumulating technical debt
