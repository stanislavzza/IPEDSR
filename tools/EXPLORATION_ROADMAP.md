# COMPREHENSIVE IPEDS DATABASE EXPLORATION PLAN
# Your roadmap for exploring and documenting the IPEDS DuckDB database

## DATABASE OVERVIEW
Based on initial exploration, your database contains:
- **952 tables** spanning multiple decades (2004-2024 core data)
- **751,895 records** in 2024 data alone
- **21 years** of comprehensive IPEDS coverage
- **Major survey components**: HD, EFFY, C, IC, F, S, and many others

## EXPLORATION PHASES

### PHASE 1: ✅ COMPLETED - Database Schema Understanding
**What we learned:**
- Database structure and table naming patterns
- Volume and scope of data (nearly 1 million records in sample)
- Survey component identification (HD, EFFY, C, etc.)
- Data coverage by year (2004-2024 with 20+ tables per recent year)

### PHASE 2: ✅ COMPLETED - DuckDB Interface Mastery  
**What we learned:**
- Connection patterns using IPEDSR::ensure_connection()
- DuckDB-specific SQL features (PRAGMA, FILTER, EXPLAIN)
- Performance characteristics (columnar storage, fast aggregations)
- Metadata exploration techniques

### PHASE 3: IPEDS Data Relationships (NEXT)
**Goals:**
- Map how UNITID connects tables across survey components
- Understand institutional coverage patterns
- Identify data quality issues and missing data patterns
- Document survey component purposes and relationships

**Approach:**
1. Start with HD (Institutional Directory) as the foundation
2. Explore EFFY (Enrollment) patterns and coverage
3. Map C (Completions) relationships to institutions
4. Understand IC (Institutional Characteristics) data
5. Document cross-table join patterns

### PHASE 4: Research Query Development
**Goals:**
- Build practical examples for higher education research
- Create templates for longitudinal analysis
- Develop complex multi-table analytical queries
- Test performance with realistic research scenarios

**Example Research Questions to Address:**
- Enrollment trends by institution type (2004-2024)
- Degree completion patterns by field of study
- Institutional characteristic changes over time
- Financial data analysis and trends
- Geographic patterns in higher education data

### PHASE 5: User-Friendly Tools Development
**Goals:**
- Create functions that hide SQL complexity
- Build guided exploration interfaces
- Develop data discovery tools
- Create documentation for different user skill levels

## RECOMMENDED STARTING APPROACH

### Week 1: Data Relationships Mapping
```r
# Start with these key tables:
library(IPEDSR)
con <- ensure_connection()

# Foundation: Institutional Directory
DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT UNITID, INSTNM, STABBR, SECTOR FROM HD2024 LIMIT 10")

# Core data: Fall Enrollment  
DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT UNITID, EFYTOTLT FROM EFFY2024 LIMIT 10")

# Join pattern example
DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "
  SELECT h.INSTNM, h.STABBR, e.EFYTOTLT 
  FROM HD2024 h 
  JOIN EFFY2024 e ON h.UNITID = e.UNITID 
  LIMIT 10
")
```

### Week 2: Survey Component Deep Dive
Focus on 2-3 survey components:
- **HD (Directory)**: Institution names, locations, basic characteristics
- **EFFY (Enrollment)**: Student headcounts by demographics
- **C (Completions)**: Degrees and certificates awarded

### Week 3: Longitudinal Analysis Patterns
- Compare institution counts across years
- Identify consistent vs. changing institutions
- Understand data collection evolution

### Week 4: User Interface Development
- Build wrapper functions for common queries
- Create data discovery tools
- Develop documentation examples

## TOOLS TO BUILD

### A. Database Browser Functions
```r
# Examples of functions to create:
browse_tables()           # List tables by year/component
table_info(table_name)    # Show structure and sample data
find_institutions(pattern) # Search institution names
check_coverage(year)      # Show data availability
```

### B. Data Quality Checkers
```r
missing_data_report(table) # Missing value analysis
value_range_check(table)   # Identify outliers
consistency_check(years)   # Cross-year validation
```

### C. Relationship Mappers
```r
show_joinable_tables(table)     # Find related tables
common_institutions(year1, year2) # Institution overlap
survey_component_map()          # Component relationships
```

### D. Query Builders
```r
enrollment_trends(institution_type, years)
completion_analysis(field_of_study, years)  
institutional_profile(unitid)
comparative_analysis(unitids, metrics)
```

## DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY

### For SQL-Experienced Users (like you):
- Advanced query examples
- Performance optimization tips
- DuckDB-specific features
- Complex analytical patterns

### For R Users with Limited SQL:
- High-level wrapper functions
- Guided exploration workflows
- Template queries with parameters
- Point-and-click data discovery

### For Research-Focused Users:
- Domain-specific query examples
- Higher education metrics calculations
- Longitudinal analysis templates
- Visualization-ready data extraction

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Pick your starting component**: I recommend HD (directory) + EFFY (enrollment)
2. **Explore 2-3 years**: Compare 2022, 2023, 2024 for patterns
3. **Build first join example**: HD + EFFY for institution names + enrollment
4. **Document what you learn**: Note patterns, surprises, data quality issues
5. **Create first wrapper function**: Something like `get_institutional_profile(unitid)`

## SUCCESS METRICS
